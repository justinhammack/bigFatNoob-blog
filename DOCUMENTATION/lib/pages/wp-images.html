  <h3>Setup images (auto resize script)</h3>
      <p>The image must be hosted on your domain. This is for security reasons. The file thumb.php should have 755 permissions. The folder /cache should have 777 permissions. If this doesn’t work, try giving 755 permissions to cache. See here on how to give files and folders permissions (called CHMODing).</p>
      <p>Make sure your server has the GD library for PHP enabled. Ask your hosting provider, if you don’t know what this means.</p>
      <p>Make sure that you don’t add www if your site doesn’t use it. Go to http://www.yourdomain.com . If you are redirected to http://yourdomain.com, then don’t add www. The reverse also applies.</p>
      <p>If absolute image paths (http://domain.com/uploads/image.jpg) don’t work, try using relative paths (/uploads/image.jpg)</p>
      <p>If you try to resize a massive image (a few MB in size, for example), you will run into problems. try reducing the quality of the image.</p>
  <p>If you are hosted with HostGator or if you are not sure what’s wrong, ask your hosts; often, the mod_security settings play havoc with TimThumb. Your hosts will have to al- low usage of TimThumb.</p>

While this may seem like a great idea, a computer isn’t so easily fooled. You must change the extension correctly (eg by open- ing the image in Photoshop and saving it as JPG ).</p>

      <p>The custom field value for the image path should be relative to the site root. This means you should not include the http://sitename.com bit, but include everything else. On some server setups the .htaccess file found in the scripts folder can break things. If this happens then renaming/ deleting the .htaccess file should fix things. Make sure you try all the other suggestions first. If the blog is in a sub folder then include the sub folder in the image path.</p>
